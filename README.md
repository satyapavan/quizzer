# quizzer
A generic quiz app framework

## Learnings
* Used ES6 forEach and that it gives the index of the current item in array and the array element itself. so there is no more need for a 'counter' variables
* 'String Literals' these are 
    * Multi-line capabilities
    * No more having to escape quotes within quotes because template literals use backticks instead
    * String interpolation, so you can embed JavaScript expressions right into your strings like this: ${code_goes_here}
